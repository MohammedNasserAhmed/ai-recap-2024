|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| API Only      | Accessible solely through programmatic interfaces. |
| Open Weights  | Model weights publicly available for download and use. |


**Modality:**
| Type               | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Multimodal         | Handling multiple data types (text, image, audio, video). |
| Unimodal (Text)    | Focusing exclusively on text data.             |
| Unimodal (Image)   | Focusing exclusively on image data.            |
| Unimodal (Audio)   | Focusing exclusively on audio data.            |
| Unimodal (Video)   | Focusing exclusively on video data.            |

**Novelty/Lifecycle:**
| Type               | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| New Model          | Completely novel AI architectures or approaches. |
